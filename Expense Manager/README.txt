Code for an expense manager to be ran on an Android device. This program uses fragments to lay on top of the main view.
Fragments are an easy way to switch between activities without taking so much time.
The user is able to enter the name and cost of the expense and when submitted it is saved to the home screen. Long
clicking on the expense will delete that expense.
